<p align="left"> Step 1. Create a resource group inside Microsoft Azure</p>
<p> > Once login to Azure, you'll see the landing page. It is from here where you'd be able to locate the different services that Azure has to offer. </p>
<p> > You could either search for *Resource Groups in the search engine at the top of the page or click on the shortcut. </p>
<p> > Once on the Resource Group landing page, you're going to go to *Create </p>

</p>

<br>

<p> Step 2. Naming your Resource Group and Setting the Deployment Region </p>
<p> > You can name your RG anything you'd like </p>
<p> > When setting the region of deployment, you could choose any region but you'd want to consider a few factors: i.e network connectivity, cost considerations, service availability, etc. </p>
<p> > Once you name RG and select the region of deployment, select *Review & Create* </p>
<p> > Your RG now goes through a validation phase. Once it passes validation, you may now select *Create* to create your RG.

</p>
</br>

<br>
<p> Step 3. Creating your Virtual Machine(s)</p>
<p> > Using Azure resource landing page, you could use the search box or find the shortcut to select Virtual Machines.</p>
<p> > Once on the Create a Virtual Machine landing page, be sure the subscription textbox is filled out with the appropriate subscription.</p>
<p> > In the Resource Group textbox, be sure to choose the RG that you created previously.
<p> > Virtual machine name: Choose it wisely. Try not to make it complicated.
<p> > Region: Choose the same region as you did when setting up your RG.</p>
<p> > Image: Choose the operating system based on your needs. In the sample photo, Windows 10 Pro, 
        version 22H2 was used. </p>
